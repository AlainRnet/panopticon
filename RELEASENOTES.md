## Release highlights

**üöÄ First public release ü•≥**. This is the first publicly released version of Akeeba Panopticon, our new, Open Source, free of charge site monitoring application. This version supports sites running on Joomla!‚Ñ¢ 3.9, 3.10, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 5.0 running on PHP versions 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3.

**Free as in beer, _and_ as in freedom**. Panopticon is Free and Open Source Software. It is distributed free of charge under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3, or any later version of the license published by the Free Software Foundation. 

**Joomla! site monitoring**. Keep an eye on the Joomla!, PHP, and installed extensions version. Install updates automatically, or receive an email when updates are available (emails currently supported for Joomla core updates only).

**Akeeba Backup Professional integration**. Take backups of your sites remotely, manually or on a schedule. Perform basic backup management directly from Panopticon. This feature requires Akeeba Backup Professional and its Web Services plugin to be installed and configured on your site.

**Admin Tools Professional integration**. Quickly unblock yourself if Admin Tools Professional locks you out of your site. Get a quick overview of the PHP File Change Scanner runs on your site, and read their reports directly on your site with a convenient direct-link button. This feature requires Admin Tools Professional and its Web Services plugin to be installed and configured on your site.

**Invite your clients**. Use the powerful user group and permissions system in Panopticon to create limited accounts for your clients, so they can see information on their own sites (but not anyone else's sites!). 

**Full white-labeling**. You can change all aspects of the HTML output for a full white-labeling experience. We even provide the SCSS sources to make it easier for you!

**Extensible**. Need to change how something works? Got a need for a bespoke feature? No problem! You can create your own code, in its own separate directory, so you neither have to do ‚Äúcore hacks‚Äù, nor risk your changes being undone with the next update. The framework we use (Akeeba Web Framework ‚Äî AWF) is stable, rock‚Äìsolid, and very similar to Joomla's MVC, providing a reliable and familiar environment for custom development.
