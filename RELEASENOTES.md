## 🔎 Release highlights

🔣 This release is focused on improving the translation experience.

**✏️ Translations now use PO files instead of a third party service**.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

* PHP 8.1, 8.2, or 8.3. PHP 8.2 recommended.
* MySQL 5.7 or later, or MariaDB 10.3 or later. MySQL 8.0 recommended.
* Ability to run CRON jobs, either command-line (recommended) or URLs with a frequency of once every minute and an
  execution time of at least 30 seconds (up to 180 seconds is strongly preferred).
* Obviously, the server it runs on must be connected to the Internet, so it can communicate with your sites.

## 🔮 What's coming next?

Development of Akeeba Panopticon takes place _in public_. You can see what we're planning, thinking of, and working on
in [our issues tracker](https://github.com/akeeba/panopticon/issues).

Issues marked as _contemplating_ are those where we're still figuring out how to best implement in a way that makes
sense.

Issues marked as _planned_ are those which are being actively worked on, or queued up for implementation in the next
version.

Some issues may have been opened by third parties. Usually, they are relegated
to [Discussions](https://github.com/akeeba/panopticon/discussions), which is the best way to provide your feedback,
and/or engage in discussion about a new feature, improving an existing feature, or describing a behaviour you find
confusing. When there's something actionable in a discussion we will create a new issue with one of the aforementioned
tags, or with the _bug_ tag to indicate something that's broken and needs to be fixed.

Kindly remember that the order and timeframe for implementation largely depends on our available time, and our
assessment of expected complexity, and interdependencies between features. Security issues and bugs always take priority
over new features; there's no point polishing a broken glass. Thank you for your understanding!
