Happy New Year!

We are happy to present you with Panopticon 1.1.0, nicknamed ‚ÄúDawn‚Äù. 

‚ú® **Dashboard layout for Sites Overview** [gh-395] The main page of Panopticon, the Sites Overview, now comes with two alternate styles. On one hand we have the classic tabular format you love, or love to hate. On the other hand we have the brand new, much more compact, Dashboard format which can also reload periodically ‚Äì really useful when you're keeping tabs on dozens of sites being updated. This feature is currently in beta. Most importantly, it paves the way for auto-refreshing page areas in future releases, by introducing [Petite Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue) to our workflow. Yes, there are plans to make parts of the Site Information page dynamic in the future.

‚ú® **SSL/TLS certificate information display, and sending expiration warning emails** [gh-397] All of our sites are now using HTTPS ‚Äì if not, they should. Most of them use automatically renewing, free of charge TLS (incorrectly called SSL; SSL has been dead for nearly 30 years) certificates issued by Let's Encrypt, CloudFlare, etc. Some sites don't have their certificates auto-renew. In others, the automation breaks. When a certificate expires without being replaced the site starts throwing errors for its visitors. Don't panic! Panopticon will now show you the TLS certificate status and warn you, including by email, when it's about to expire. You get to choose when to get a reminder.

‚ú® **Report latest backup status** [gh-396] You can now quickly see the latest backup status in the Sites Overview page. This is updated when the site information is updated (by default: every 15'), and will show you the status of your backups even if the backup is taken outside of Panopticon, e.g. CLI CRON jobs, Joomla! Scheduled Tasks etc. You will also be warned if the backup is older than a certain amount of time, which can be configured per site.

‚ú® **Support for site favicons** Panopticon will now display the favicons of the sites in the Sites Overview and Site Information pages, helping you visually identify which site is which.

‚ú® **Select language in Setup** [gh-384] You can now choose the language to display the installer in when installing Panopticon. _Enfin!_

‚ú® **Language selection after logging in** [gh-490] Have you ever logged into Panopticon only to find yourself starting at the wrong language? Fear not. You can now switch to a different language without having to log out.

‚ú® **Change the rotated log names** [gh-398] The rotated log files are now given more reasonable names, without showing up as log files for an unlreated site.

‚ú® **Preload hints, and HTTP 103 Early Hints** [gh-458] As long as your web server supports it, Panopticon will send HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 preload hints. If you are using [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev/) it will also send HTTP 103 Early Hint headers with that information, making the page load even faster.

‚ú® **Additional colour themes (CSS) and easier theme selection** Panopticon now comes with additional colour themes (CSS files), and a drop-down to select them:

* Aegean. Deep blue and white, the colours of the Aegean Sea.
* Minty (by Bootswatch). Pastel greens and pink, like a mint candy.
* Scuderia. Legendary racing livery.
* WinterCandy. Pastel blues and plum.

All additional colour themes, except those marked as ‚Äúby Bootswatch‚Äù, were created by us. Additional colour themes, except Aegean, are not very good for accessibility and/or look weird in Dark Mode.

**Loads of accessibility and design tweaks**. A lot of time and effort was spent by @brianteeman to tweak a lot of views for design consistency and accessibility. Hats off to Brian for his rigorous testing and prolific PRs!

Last, but not least, we identified and terminated a number of bugs _with extreme prejudice_. Quality of life matters.

## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

* PHP 8.1, 8.2, or 8.3. PHP 8.2 recommended.
* MySQL 5.7 or later, or MariaDB 10.3 or later. MySQL 8.0 recommended.
* Ability to run CRON jobs, either command-line (recommended) or URLs with a frequency of once every minute and an
  execution time of at least 30 seconds (up to 180 seconds is strongly preferred).
* Obviously, the server it runs on must be connected to the Internet, so it can communicate with your sites.

## üîÆ What's coming next?

Development of Akeeba Panopticon takes place _in public_. You can see what we're planning, thinking of, and working on in [our issues tracker](https://github.com/akeeba/panopticon/issues).

Kindly remember that the order and timeframe for implementation largely depends on our available time, our assessment of expected complexity, and interdependencies between features. Security issues and bugs always take priority over new features; there's no point polishing a broken glass. Thank you for your understanding!
