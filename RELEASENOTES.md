## 🔮 What's coming next?

Development of Akeeba Panopticon takes place _in public_. You can see what we're planning, thinking of, and working on in [our issues tracker](https://github.com/akeeba/panopticon/issues).

Kindly remember that the order and timeframe for implementation largely depends on our available time, our assessment of expected complexity, and interdependencies between features. Security issues and bugs always take priority over new features; there's no point polishing a broken glass. Thank you for your understanding!
