The software is provided free of charge. Personalised support and custom development for it is not.

We are nevertheless more than happy to work with our community peers to resolve reproducible issues and implement new features to the extent they are aligned with our vision for the software.

## Be kind

First and foremost, we kindly ask that you respect us and other contributors to this project.

Remember that using, and participating in the development of, Free and Open Source Software is a _privilege_, not a right. The contributors to the project don't owe you anything, especially their (unpaid) time. If you disagree with these two statements we kindly ask you to refrain from participating in this project. There are paid, closed-source services which do what Panopticon does.

## Issues

Issues on GitHub are meant as a to-do and to-fix list for the developers. Please do not use them for support requests.

If you are a subscriber you may be entitled to paid support on our site, akeeba.com. Please submit your support requests in the Support section there. Over here we can neither know if you are a subscriber, nor is it the right place.

If you are reporting an issue please do provide accurate reproduction instructions. Issues which cannot be reproduced will be closed as “Not planned” to keep our issues queue neat.

## Pull Requests

We welcome code contributions to this project!

All contributors are understood to agree with the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin) statement, indicating their explicit agreement by signing off their contribution. If you disagree with the DCO we cannot allow you to contribute code to this project.

Before you open a Pull Request we kindly ask that you open an Issue first, explaining the issue or feature request you have in mind and your intention to provide a Pull Request with the code to address this issue / implement this feature. Once you get the okay from the maintainers you may open a Pull Request.

Pull Requests without a corresponding issue may take longer to process and have a smaller chance of the Pull Request being accepted. The only exception is Pull Requests for trivial fixes and issues, not exceeding 20 lines of code, or Pull Requests about language files.

## Feature requests

We ask you to kindly keep in mind that not all feature requests can be accepted, nor can we commit to a concrete timeframe for implementation for the feature requests which are.

Feature requests may be rejected if, according to our judgement, they are incompatible with the combined needs of the target audience of this mass-distributed software, impractical, or infeasible. We are not required to provide a detailed explanation for the reasons of rejection; this time is best spent improving the software.

Accepted feature requests may not be implemented. An accepted feature request will undergo further scrutiny. It is possible that at this stage we discover a fundamental issue which does not allow us to implement it after all. In no case can we commit to a definitive implementation timeline, unless there is a paid development contract involved.

## Translations

Between the two of us at Akeeba Ltd, we are only proficient in English, Greek, and Italian. Please do not ask us for language files in a language we do not speak.

If, however, you do speak a language and would like to contribute a translation you're more than welcome! Please let us know of your intention in a Discussions or Issues thread. If there is enough interest we might consider using a translation environment in the future to lower the barrier for translations contribution.
