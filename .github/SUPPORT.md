The software is provided free of charge. Personalised support and custom development for it is not.

If you want personalised support from the maintainers please purchase a subscription [on our site](akeeba.com) and file a support ticket on our site's Support ticket system. The proceeds from the subscriptions go towards continued development and maintenance of this software.

## Community Support

Discussions are open for everybody, as long as the topic is about the use of this software. Off-topic discussions will be locked or removed. 

You can use Discussions to ask for support from other community members (not the maintainers), but there is no guarantee you will get a response, or that it will be accurate.

If you have subscribed on our site _do not_ use Discussions to ask for support. We cannot guarantee that we will see your request, or that we will be possible to correlate your GitHub username with your subscription on our site. Instead, use the support ticket system on our site. 

## Using Issues

Issues on GitHub are meant as a to-do and to-fix list for the developers.

Use them only for reporting verifiable issues with reproduction instructions. Issues which cannot be reproduced, as well as support requests, will be converted to Discussions to keep our issues queue neat.

If you submit an issue which has been already discussed or address, the issue will be closed with the label “duplicate”, for productivity reasons.
