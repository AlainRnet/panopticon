## Bug Reports

First, please check the Issues and Pull Requests tabs for similar reports. Keep in mind that the issue or pull request (PR) might be _closed_; the GitHub search defaults to open issues / PRs only.

If you believe you have found a new issue, please collect the information pertaining to the bug:

* Version of Panopticon
* Version of your CMS
* Version of PHP for both the Panopticon and CMS server
* Reproduction instructions (which you have verified on a different site than where you came across the issue)

Then, create a new Issue. Do not label it as a Bug. Labels are only applied by maintainers after initial triage.

If you are affected by an existing issue, **PLEASE** do not comment “Me too” or “+1” on an existing issue; it makes it hard to follow the conversation surrounding an issue. Instead, put a “thumbs up” reaction in the issue description.

## Feature Requests

Please check Issues and Pull Requests (both open _and_ closed ones) for similar feature requests. Do not file duplicates. If we come across a duplicate we have already addressed we will close your Issue / Pull Request with the label “duplicate” without further explanation, for productivity reasons. 

When requesting a feature, please keep in mind that the software is meant to cover a multitude of use cases across thousands of users, from novices to hardcore PHP developers. When submitting a feature request try to think not about your own use case, but also how this feature would affect other users of the software.

Any feature implemented requires a major time commitment from the maintainers. It's not just the time to implement and document it, though that's not insignificant either. It's also the time required to maintain this feature throughout the lifetime of the software, and whether it might lead to an increase in support requests. This time needs to be taken away from other software or features of this software. Think about your feature request in these terms before asserting it's a “simple” change.

If you are sure that the impact is justified, please open an Issue and make your case. Explain what you are trying to do, why you believe it is not currently possible, and how you envision your use case would be made possible. Do explain how expect the implementation of this feature to affect other users.

Maintainers have the last word, even if you plan to implement this feature yourself. If we believe that there will be a negative impact to other users or our time management we might decide against a feature. We might decide against a feature if we believe it's not relevant to the direction we want the software to take, consider it out of scope for this software, or consider it as having a negative effect to our business.

## Pull Requests

All contributors are understood to agree with the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin) statement, indicating their explicit agreement by signing off their contribution. If you disagree with the DCO we can regrettably not accept your contribution.

Before you open a Pull Request we kindly ask that you open an Issue first, explaining the issue or feature request you have in mind and your intention to provide a Pull Request with the code to address this issue / implement this feature. Once you get the okay from the maintainers you may open a Pull Request. This is to help you avoid wasting time, in case the issue / feature you are addressing is already being handled in a different way, or not planned to be implemented.

Pull Requests without a corresponding issue may take longer to process and have a smaller chance of the Pull Request being accepted. The only exception is Pull Requests for trivial fixes and issues, not exceeding 20 lines of code, as well as Pull Requests about language files.

## Translations

Between the two of us at Akeeba Ltd, we are only proficient in English, Greek, and Italian. Please do not ask us for language files in a language we do not speak.

If, however, you do speak a language and would like to contribute a translation you're more than welcome! Please let us know of your intention in a Discussions or Issues thread. If there is enough interest we might consider using a translation environment in the future to lower the barrier for translations contribution.
