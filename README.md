# Akeeba Panopticon

Remote site management and backup scheduling

## What is it?

Akeeba Panopticon is a standalone PHP application. You install on a domain or subdomain separate from your sites. You can then use it to manage your Joomla 4 (and later) sites remotely, including managing core and 3PD extension updates, as well as managing, and scheduling, backups with Akeeba Backup Professional.

## WORK IN PROGRESS

This is work in progress. It will take a while before it's in a usable state. The target for stable release is Q2 2024, depending on the breadth and depth of changes in upcoming Joomla and PHP versions.

## Building from sources

**TODO: Expand on this**

Install Akeeba BuildFiles one level up, on `buildfiles`

Run `phing git` in the repo's root.

Requires Composer and NPM to be already installed.
